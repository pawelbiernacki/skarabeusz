SKARABEUSZ - a paragraph game generator.

You can use skarabeusz to generate a number of PNG files containing random maps for all the levels (maze_?.png) and an associated TEX document referring to it (maze.tex).

The amount of levels depends on the "z range". By default it is 1.

Then you should compile the TEX file with the pdflatex tool. This will produce a PDF file that is the end result (a paragraph game).

Skarabeusz currently supports English, Polish and Russian.

Skarabeusz accepts the following options (in any order):
    -x <x_range>
    -y <y range>
    -z <z range>
    -c <amount of chambers>
    -a <amount of alternative endings>
    -p <prefix>
    -o (html|latex)
    -l (english|polish|russian|finnish)
    --hints
    --stories (good|bad|random|alignment)
    --books
    --heroes <amount of heroes>
    -v

Running skarabeusz with no parameters at all works as:

skarabeusz -x 10 -y 7 -z 1 -c 5 -a 1 -p "map" -o latex

Warning: Making c too high will cause skarabeusz to run very long.

Activating hints makes the game very easy - each person you meet will tell you how far you are from the closest ending.

Activating stories makes the generator to add a story after each transaction (exchanging keys).
There are following stories modes:

    - good stories - helping you to win the game
    - bad stories - stories about guys who failed
    - random - this is the default setting, it tells you about some journey through the maze
    - alignment - the stories told (or written) by a character are always good or always bad
                    depending on his alignment
