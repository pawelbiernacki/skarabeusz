SKARABEUSZ - a paragraph game generator.

You can use skarabeusz to generate a number of PNG files containing random maps for all the levels (maze_?.png) and an associated TEX document referring to it (maze.tex).

The amount of levels depends on the "z range". By default it is 1.

Then you should compile the TEX file with the pdflatex tool. This will produce a PDF file that is the end result (a paragraph game).

Skarabeusz currently supports English, Polish and Russian, depending on the LANG environment variable.

Make LANG to be "pl_PL.UTF-8" to have an output in Polish.

Skarabeusz accepts the following options (in any order):
    -x <x_range>
    -y <y range>
    -z <z range>
    -c <amount of chambers>
    -a <amount of alternative endings>
    -p <prefix>
    -o (html|latex)
    -v

Running skarabeusz with no parameters at all works as:

skarabeusz -x 10 -y 7 -z 1 -c 5 -a 1 -p "map" -o latex

Warning: Making c too high will cause skarabeusz to run very long.
